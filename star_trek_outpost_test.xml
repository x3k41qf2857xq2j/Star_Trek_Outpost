<itunes:summary>Star Trek Audio Drama from Giant Gnome Productions.  Life is good for Lt. Greg Torkelson aboard the USS Remington, a Starfleet research vessel stationed near the Venderis Nebula. However, when word comes that he’s been promoted to the Executive Officer of Deep Space Station 3, an outpost in the backwaters of Federation space, he quickly discovers that all is not as it appears, and what seems to be too good to be true just might be.
